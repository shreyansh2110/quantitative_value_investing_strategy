# Quantutative Value Investing Strategy Project using Python

"Value investing" means investing in the stocks that are cheapest relative to common measures of business value (like earnings or assets).
In this project, I have built an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the best value metrics. From there, I calculated recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.
